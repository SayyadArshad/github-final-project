Simple Interest Calculator

A lightweight calculator that computes Simple Interest based on user-provided inputs.

This project focuses on clarity and correctness. No unnecessary features, no hidden logic.

Overview

The calculator determines:

Simple Interest

Total Amount (Principal + Interest)

It uses the standard simple interest formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Inputs

Principal (P) – Initial amount of money

Rate (R) – Annual interest rate (in %)

Time (T) – Time period (in years)

Outputs

Simple Interest

Total Amount

Formula Used
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
Total Amount = P + SI

Example

Input:

Principal: 5,000

Rate: 10%

Time: 3 years

Output:

Simple Interest: 1,500
